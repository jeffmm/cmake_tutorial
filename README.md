* [use git submodules](v2-submodules)
* [build example executables with your library](v3-examples)
* [create Catch2 unit tests](v4-unit-tests)
* [build documentation with Doxygen using CMake](v5-documentation)
* [use continuous integration with Travis CI](v6-continuous-integration)
* [use Docker to ship pre-compiled libraries in a platform-independent way](v7-docker)
* [scaffold your future projects using Cookiecutter](v7-cookiecutter)

Step-by-step instructions for following along with the project are in the subfolder READMEs.
