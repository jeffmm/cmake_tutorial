TakeTwo is a small project used for teaching how to:
* organize a C++ library using CMake

* create Catch2 unit tests
* use continuous integration with Travis CI
* scaffold your future projects using a cookie-cutter

Step-by-step instructions for how to progressively build the project are in the subfolder READMEs.
